Probability Bootcamp,Gentle Introduction to Probability: Counting Coin Flips and Dice,"This video provides a simple introduction to probability, starting with the basic idea of counting random events.  We will use random coin flips and dice rolls to illustrate these concepts.  Interestingly, neither coin flips or dice rolls are actually random, but there is enough uncertainty in their motion that to us humans, they appear random.

Probability Bootcamp,Counting Probabilities with Combinatorics and the Factorial,"Here we describe some of the most useful concepts in probability: combinatorics and the factorial.  We will be able to count how many ways a certain event can happen, such as how many ways I can get 5 heads in 10 coin flips, and how many 5 card hands can I deal off of a 52 car deck.  We will discuss sampling with and without replacement, and the various formulas to compute these probabilities.

Probability Bootcamp,The Binomial Distribution and the Multinomial Distribution,"Here we introduce the binomial distribution, which is one of the most important distributions in all of probability.  It will be the basis of the Normal distribution and the Poisson distribution.  The binomial distribution quantifies the probability of getting ""r"" successes in ""n"" Bernoulli trials.  For example, the probability of getting 5 heads in 10 coin flips is Binomially distributed. We also introduce the more general multinomial distribution.

Probability Bootcamp,Conditional Probabilities,"Conditional probability is a central idea, where we compute the probability of an event ""A"" occurring given that we also have information about an event ""B"" occurring.  For example, if I roll a fair dice, event ""A"" might be that I roll a 6 and event ""B"" might be that I roll higher than a 3.  If someone tells me that ""B"" definitely occurred, then it changes the probability of ""A"", now that I know that ""B"" is true.  This will be a fundamental concept when we develop Bayesian statistics.

Probability Bootcamp,Independence in Probability,"Independence is another important concept in probability that tells if two events ""A"" and ""B"" depend on each other.  Examples of independent events would be ""A"" drawing a Queen from a deck of cards, and ""B"" drawing a spade.  These don't affect each other at all, and knowing one doesn't change the probability of the other.

Probability Bootcamp,Bernoulli and Binomial Random Variables,"Bernoulli and Binomial random variables are key building blocks for more sophisticated distributions, such as the Normal and Poisson distributions.  A Bernoulli random variable takes one of two values, like a coin flip.

Probability Bootcamp,"The Normal Distribution: The Limit of Binomial Distribution for Large ""n""","The Normal distribution, or ""Gaussian"", is one of the most important probability distributions.  It is the limit of a Binomial distribution for large ""n"" (for a large number of underlying Bernoulli trials). The normal distribution is quite common across statistics, for example to approximate the height of adults in a country.     We will find that the sums of many random variables will often converge to a Normal distribution, according to the central limit theorem, which has broad and sweeping implications in statistics.

Probability Bootcamp,The Standard Unit Normal and Probability Computations,"It is often helpful to work with a ""standard unit normal"" distribution, which is a Gaussian with zero mean and unit standard deviation.  It is possible to transform other normal distributions into this standard form, through a simple mean-centering and scaling procedure, after which it is easy to compute probabilities.  For example, if I want to know what percentile my height is in the USA, I could first transform the normal distribution of heights to standard unit normal, and then see where my transformed height lies.  This will allow me to easily compute various quantities.

Roadmap Abstract: The world faces some of its greatest challenges of modern time and how we address them will have a dramatic impact on the life for generations to come. Simultaneously, control systems, consisting of information enriched by various degrees of analytics followed by decision-making, are pervading a variety of sectors, not only in engineering but beyond, into financial services, socio-economic analysis, entertainment and sports, and political and social sciences. Increased levels of automation are sought after in various sectors and being introduced into new domains. All of these advances and transformations urge a shift in the conversation toward how control systems can meet grand societal- scale challenges. The document seeks to chart a roadmap for the evolution of control systems, identifying several areas where our discipline can have an impact over the next decade.  Edited by: Anuradha M.

Physics Informed Machine Learning,Physics Informed Machine Learning: High Level Overview of AI and ML in Science and Engineering,"This video describes how to incorporate physics into the machine learning process.  The process of machine learning is broken down into five stages: (1) formulating a problem to model, (2) collecting and curating training data to inform the model, (3) choosing an architecture with which to represent the model, (4) designing a loss function to assess the performance of the model, and (5) selecting and implementing an optimization algorithm to train the model. At each stage, we discuss how prior physical knowledge may be embedding into the process.    Physics informed machine learning is critical for many engineering applications, since many engineering systems are governed by physics and involve safety critical components.

Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics,Machine Learning for Computational Fluid Dynamics,"Machine learning is rapidly becoming a core technology for scientific computing, with numerous opportunities to advance the field of computational fluid dynamics. This paper highlights some of the areas of highest potential impact, including to accelerate direct numerical simulations, to improve turbulence closure modeling, and to develop enhanced reduced-order models. In each of these areas, it is possible to improve machine learning capabilities by incorporating physics into the process, and in turn, to improve the simulation of fluids to uncover new physical understanding. Despite the promise of machine learning described here, we also note that classical methods are often more efficient for many tasks. We also emphasize that in order to harness the full potential of machine learning to improve computational fluid dynamics, it is essential for the community to continue to establish benchmark systems and best practices for open-source software, data sharing, and reproducible research.

Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics,Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) in unsteady fluids with Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents (FTLE),"Fluid dynamics are often characterized by coherent structures that persist in time and mediate the behavior and transport of the fluid.  Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) are a particularly important class of coherent structures, as they are the time-varying analogues of stable and unstable manifolds from dynamical systems theory, and they represent material lines of attraction and repulsion in the fluid.  LCS are often computed via the Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) field, which involves computing the stretching between neighboring passive particles that are advected (integrated) along the flow field.

Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics,"Turbulence: Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (Part 1, Mass Continuity Equation)","One of the most common strategies to model a turbulent fluid flow is to attempt to model the average, or mean flow field, by expanding the velocity field into an average and a fluctuating component.  This video introduces this idea of ""Reynolds averaging"" and shows how to obtain a mass continuity equation for the mean flow.

Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics,Turbulence Closure Models: Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) & Large Eddy Simulations (LES),"Turbulent fluid dynamics are often too complex to model every detail.  Instead, we tend to model bulk quantities and low-resolution approximations.  To remain physical, these reduced approximations of the Navier-Stokes equations must be ""closed"", and turbulence closure modeling is one of the most important topics in high-performance computing and scientific computing.  This video describes several leading approaches, including the Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations and large eddy simulations (LES).

Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics,Enhancing Computational Fluid Dynamics with Machine Learning,"Research abstract by Ricardo Vinuesa (@rvinuesa) from KTH!! Twitter: @ricardovinuesa  In this video we discuss the recent article published in Nature Computational Science by Ricardo Vinuesa and Steve Brunton, where the potential of machine learning (ML) to improve numerical simulations of fluid flows is discussed. In particular, we show the possibilities enabled by ML in the context of 1) accelerating direct numerical simulations (DNSs); 2) improving turbulence modeling for large-eddy simulations (LESs) and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations; and also enhancing the development of reduced-order models (ROMs). Focusing on the latter, we describe a deep-learning framework for learning a minimal and near-orthogonal set of non-linear modes in the context of turbulent flows. In particular, we focus on a high-fidelity numerical database of a simplified urban environment. The proposed technique relies on β-variational autoencoders (β-VAEs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which enable extracting non-linear modes while encouraging the learning of statistically-independent latent variables and penalizing the size of the latent vector. We demonstrate that by constraining the shape of the latent space, it is possible to motivate orthogonality and extract a set of parsimonious modes which enable high-quality reconstruction. This method exhibits an excellent performance in the reconstruction against linear-theory-based decompositions, where the energy percentage captured by the proposed method from five modes is equal to 87.36% against 32.41% from proper-orthogonal decomposition (POD).

Dynamical Systems (with Machine Learning),PDE FIND,"We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain.  The regression framework relies on sparsity promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models.   The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis.  Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework where the sensors move with the dynamics.  The method is computationally efficient, robust, and is demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation.  Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially non-unique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data.  Thus for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation or the Korteweg-deVries equation, for instance.   The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parametrized spatio-temporal systems where first-principles derivations are intractable.",00:10:36

This video was produced at the University of Washington",00:08:33
Control Bootcamp,Model Predictive Control,"This lecture provides an overview of model predictive control (MPC), which is one of the most powerful and general control frameworks.  MPC is used extensively in industrial control settings, and can be used with nonlinear systems and systems with constraints on the state or actuation input.   Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics for model predictive control in the low-data limit E. Kaiser, J. N. Kutz, and S. L.

Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,Data-Driven Resolvent Analysis,"Benjamin Herrmann describes a data-driven algorithm to perform resolvent analysis from fluid mechanics to obtain the leading forcing and response modes, without recourse to the governing equations, but instead based on snapshots of the transient evolution of linearly stable flows.  This approach is based on two established facts: 1) dynamic mode decomposition can approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the underlying operator governing the evolution of a system from measurement data, and 2) a projection of the resolvent operator onto an invariant subspace can be built from this learned eigendecomposition.

Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,Identifying Dominant Balance Physics from Data - Jared Callaham,"This video illustrates a new algorithm to identify local dominant physical balance relations from multiscale spatiotemporal data.   Title: Learning dominant physical processes with data-driven balance models Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10019 Authors: Jared L. Callaham,  J. Nathan Kutz, Bingni W. Brunton , and Steven L. Brunton  Code available at: https://github.com/dynamicslab/dominant-balance  Abstract: Throughout the history of science, physics-based modeling has relied on judiciously approximating observed dynamics as a balance between a few dominant processes. However, this traditional approach is mathematically cumbersome and only applies in asymptotic regimes where there is a strict separation of scales in the physics. Here, we automate and generalize this approach to non-asymptotic regimes by introducing the idea of an equation space, in which different local balances appear as distinct subspace clusters. Unsupervised learning can then automatically identify regions where groups of terms may be neglected. We show that our data-driven balance models successfully delineate dominant balance physics in a much richer class of systems. In particular, this approach uncovers key mechanistic models from the past hundred years in turbulence, nonlinear optics, geophysical fluids, and neuroscience.

Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,PDE FIND,"We propose a sparse regression method capable of discovering the governing partial differential equation(s) of a given system by time series measurements in the spatial domain.  The regression framework relies on sparsity promoting techniques to select the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the governing equations that most accurately represent the data, bypassing a combinatorially large search through all possible candidate models.   The method balances model complexity and regression accuracy by selecting a parsimonious model via Pareto analysis.  Time series measurements can be made in an Eulerian framework where the sensors are fixed spatially, or in a Lagrangian framework where the sensors move with the dynamics.  The method is computationally efficient, robust, and is demonstrated to work on a variety of canonical problems spanning a number of scientific domains including Navier-Stokes, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and the diffusion equation.  Moreover, the method is capable of disambiguating between potentially non-unique dynamical terms by using multiple time series taken with different initial data.  Thus for a traveling wave, the method can distinguish between a linear wave equation or the Korteweg-deVries equation, for instance.   The method provides a promising new technique for discovering governing equations and physical laws in parametrized spatio-temporal systems where first-principles derivations are intractable.",00:10:36

Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,"Finite-Horizon, Energy-Optimal Trajectories in Unsteady Flows","This video by Kartik Krishna investigates the use of finite-horizon model predictive control (MPC) for the energy-efficient trajectory planning of an active mobile sensor in an unsteady fluid flow.  Connections between the finite-time optimal trajectories and finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) of the background flow are established, confirming that energy-efficient trajectories exploit Lagrangian coherent structures in the flow dynamics.   Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10556 by Kartik Krishna, Zhuoyuan Song, and Steven L. Brunton  Code: https://github.com/karkris41295/single-agent-MPC-FTLE  Full abstract:  Intelligent mobile sensors, such as uninhabited aerial or underwater vehicles, are becoming prevalent in environmental sensing and monitoring applications. These active sensing platforms operate in unsteady fluid flows, including windy urban environments, hurricanes, and ocean currents. Often constrained in their actuation capabilities, the dynamics of these mobile sensors depend strongly on the background flow, making their deployment and control particularly challenging. Therefore, efficient trajectory planning with partial knowledge about the background flow is essential for teams of mobile sensors to adaptively sense and monitor their environments. In this work, we investigate the use of finite-horizon model predictive control (MPC) for the energy-efficient trajectory planning of an active mobile sensor in an unsteady fluid flow field. We uncover connections between the finite-time optimal trajectories and finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) of the background flow, confirming that energy-efficient trajectories exploit invariant coherent structures in the flow. We demonstrate our findings on the unsteady double gyre vector field, which is a canonical model for chaotic mixing in the ocean. We present an exhaustive search through critical MPC parameters including the prediction horizon, maximum sensor actuation, and relative penalty on the accumulated state error and actuation effort. We find that even relatively short prediction horizons can often yield nearly energy-optimal trajectories. These results are promising for the adaptive planning of energy-efficient trajectories for swarms of mobile sensors in distributed sensing and monitoring.

Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,Kernel Learning for Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition,"In this video abstract, I present our new data-driven method for learning high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamical systems via kernel methods.  This work is in collaboration with Profs Benjamin Herrmann, Beverley McKeon and Steve Brunton.  The paper is available on arXiv: Title: Kernel Learning for Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Linear and Nonlinear Disambiguation Optimization (LANDO) Authors: Peter J. Baddoo, Benjamin Herrmann, Beverley J. McKeon, Steven L. Brunton https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01510  Here's the technical abstract for the paper: _______________________________________________________________________ Research in modern data-driven dynamical systems is typically focused on the three key challenges of high dimensionality, unknown dynamics, and nonlinearity. The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a cornerstone for modeling high-dimensional systems from data. However, the quality of the linear DMD model is known to be fragile with respect to strong nonlinearity, which contaminates the model estimate. In contrast, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) learns fully nonlinear models, disambiguating the linear and nonlinear effects, but is restricted to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we present a kernel method that learns interpretable data-driven models for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Our method performs kernel regression on a sparse dictionary of samples that appreciably contribute to the underlying dynamics. We show that this kernel method efficiently handles high-dimensional data and is flexible enough to incorporate partial knowledge of system physics. It is possible to accurately recover the linear model contribution with this approach, disambiguating the effects of the implicitly defined nonlinear terms, resulting in a DMD-like model that is robust to strongly nonlinear dynamics. We demonstrate our approach on data from a wide range of nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in the physical sciences. This framework can be used for many practical engineering tasks such as model order reduction, diagnostics, prediction, control, and discovery of governing laws. _______________________________________________________________________  Thanks to Prof Steve Brunton at the University of Washington for letting me use his lightboard studio.

Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,Deep Delay Autoencoders Discover Dynamical Systems w Latent Variables: Deep Learning meets Dynamics!,"Video abstract for ""Discovering Governing Equations from Partial Measurements with Deep Delay Autoencoders""  by Joseph Bakarji, Kathleen Champion, J. Nathan Kutz, Steven L. Brunton  https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05136  https://www.josephbakarji.com/  A central challenge in data-driven model discovery is the presence of hidden, or latent, variables that are not directly measured but are dynamically important. Takens' theorem provides conditions for when it is possible to augment these partial measurements with time delayed information, resulting in an attractor that is diffeomorphic to that of the original full-state system. However, the coordinate transformation back to the original attractor is typically unknown, and learning the dynamics in the embedding space has remained an open challenge for decades. Here, we design a custom deep autoencoder network to learn a coordinate transformation from the delay embedded space into a new space where it is possible to represent the dynamics in a sparse, closed form. We demonstrate this approach on the Lorenz, Rössler, and Lotka-Volterra systems, learning dynamics from a single measurement variable. As a challenging example, we learn a Lorenz analogue from a single scalar variable extracted from a video of a chaotic waterwheel experiment. The resulting modeling framework combines deep learning to uncover effective coordinates and the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) for interpretable modeling. Thus, we show that it is possible to simultaneously learn a closed-form model and the associated coordinate system for partially observed dynamics.

Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,Physics-Informed Dynamic Mode Decomposition (PI-DMD),"In this video, Peter Baddoo from MIT (www.baddoo.co.uk) explains how physical laws can be integrated into the dynamic mode decomposition.   Title: Physics-informed dynamic mode decomposition (piDMD) Authors: Peter J. Baddoo, Benjamin Herrmann, Beverley J. McKeon, J. Nathan Kutz, and Steven L. Brunton Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04307   Github: https://github.com/baddoo/piDMD   Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate how physical principles -- such as symmetries, invariances, and conservation laws -- can be integrated into the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD is a widely-used data analysis technique that extracts low-rank modal structures and dynamics from high-dimensional measurements. However, DMD frequently produces models that are sensitive to noise, fail to generalize outside the training data, and violate basic physical laws. Our physics-informed DMD (piDMD) optimization, which may be formulated as a Procrustes problem, restricts the family of admissible models to a matrix manifold that respects the physical structure of the system. We focus on five fundamental physical principles -- conservation, self-adjointness, localization, causality, and shift-invariance -- and derive several closed-form solutions and efficient algorithms for the corresponding piDMD optimizations. With fewer degrees of freedom, piDMD models are less prone to overfitting, require less training data, and are often less computationally expensive to build than standard DMD models. We demonstrate piDMD on a range of challenging problems in the physical sciences, including energy-preserving fluid flow, travelling-wave systems, the Schrödinger equation, solute advection-diffusion, a system with causal dynamics, and three-dimensional transitional channel flow. In each case, piDMD significantly outperforms standard DMD in metrics such as spectral identification, state prediction, and estimation of optimal forcings and responses.

Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,Nonlinear parametric models of viscoelastic fluid flows with SINDy,"Nonlinear parametric models of viscoelastic fluid flows by Cassio M. Oishi, Alan A. Kaptanoglu, J. Nathan Kutz, Steven L. Brunton https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04405  Reduced-order models have been widely adopted in fluid mechanics, particularly in the context of Newtonian fluid flows. These models offer the ability to predict complex dynamics, such as instabilities and oscillations, at a considerably reduced computational cost. In contrast, the reduced-order modeling of non-Newtonian viscoelastic fluid flows remains relatively unexplored. This work leverages the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm to develop interpretable reduced-order models for a broad class of viscoelastic flows. In particular, we explore a benchmark oscillatory viscoelastic flow on the four-roll mill geometry using the classical Oldroyd-B fluid. This flow exemplifies many canonical challenges associated with non-Newtonian flows, including transitions, asymmetries, instabilities, and bifurcations arising from the interplay of viscous and elastic forces, all of which require expensive computations in order to resolve the fast timescales and long transients characteristic of such flows. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our data-driven surrogate model in predicting the transient evolution on a simplified representation of the dynamical system. We then describe the ability of the reduced-order model to accurately reconstruct spatial flow field in a basis obtained via proper orthogonal decomposition. Finally, we develop a fully parametric, nonlinear model that captures the dominant variations of the dynamics with the relevant nondimensional Weissenberg number. This work illustrates the potential to reduce computational costs and improve design, optimization, and control of a large class of non-Newtonian fluid flows with modern machine learning and reduced-order modeling techniques.",00:14:51

Raut, Zachary P. Rosenthal, Xiaodan Wang, Hanyang Miao, Zhanqi Zhang, Jin-Moo Lee, Marcus E. Raichle, Adam Q. Bauer, Steven L. Brunton, Bingni W. Brunton, and J. Nathan Kutz   https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.06.565918v2  Neural activity in awake organisms shows widespread and spatiotemporally diverse correlations with behavioral and physiological measurements. We propose that this covariation reflects in part the dynamics of a unified, arousal-related process that regulates brain-wide physiology on the timescale of seconds. Taken together with theoretical foundations in dynamical systems, this interpretation leads us to a surprising prediction: that a single, scalar measurement of arousal (e.g., pupil diameter) should suffice to reconstruct the continuous evolution of multimodal, spatiotemporal measurements of large-scale brain physiology. To test this hypothesis, we perform multimodal, cortex-wide optical imaging and behavioral monitoring in awake mice. We demonstrate that spatiotemporal measurements of neuronal calcium, metabolism, and blood-oxygen can be accurately and parsimoniously modeled from a low-dimensional state-space reconstructed from the time history of pupil diameter. Extending this framework to behavioral and electrophysiological measurements from the Allen Brain Observatory, we demonstrate the ability to integrate diverse experimental data into a unified generative model via mappings from an intrinsic arousal manifold. Our results support the hypothesis that spontaneous, spatially structured fluctuations in brain-wide physiology—widely interpreted to reflect regionally-specific neural communication—are in large part reflections of an arousal-related process. This enriched view of arousal dynamics has broad implications for interpreting observations of brain, body, and behavior as measured across modalities, contexts, and scales.",00:25:23
Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,Can we make commercial aircraft faster?  Mitigating transonic buffet with porous trailing edges,"Extending the aircraft flight envelope by mitigating transonic airfoil buffet  by Esther Lagemann, Steven L. Brunton, Wolfgang Schröder, Christian Lagemann   arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08894   In the age of globalization, commercial aviation plays a central role in maintaining our international connectivity by providing fast air transport services for passengers and freight. However, the upper limit of the aircraft flight envelope, essentially the maximum aircraft speed, is usually fixed by the occurrence of a safety-critical aerodynamic phenomenon called transonic airfoil buffet. It refers to shock wave oscillations occurring on the aircraft wings, which induce unsteady aerodynamic loads acting on the wing structure. Since these loads can cause severe structural damage endangering flight safety, the aviation industry is highly interested in suppressing transonic airfoil buffet to extend the flight envelope to higher aircraft speeds. In this contribution, we demonstrate with experimental wind tunnel measurements that the application of porous trailing edges substantially attenuates the buffet phenomenon. Since porous trailing edges have the additional benefit of reducing acoustic aircraft emissions, our findings could pave the way for faster air transport with reduced noise emissions.",00:16:10
Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,Using sparse trajectory data to find Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) in fluid flows,"Video by Tanner Harms, based on ""Lagrangian Gradient Regression for the Detection of Coherent Structures from Sparse Trajectory Data"" by Tanner D. Harms, Steven L. Brunton, Beverley J. McKeon https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10994  The method of Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) uses particle trajectories in fluid flows to identify coherent structures that govern the behavior of the flow.  The typical methods employed to identify LCS rely on a dense grid of numerical tracers which are seeded onto the pre-computed vector fields and advected through time and space.  However, in many systems, dense flow field information is not available, and researchers must perform their analyses on a sparse set of tracers that already exist in the flow.  For example, if we wish our flow observer to autonomously make decisions based on the flow field information, then the computational expense of the normal LCS identification pipeline is too costly to use.  It will need to use only the trajectories of the tracers that it sees in the flow.  Motivated by the desire to study flow fields autonomously, this video shows how sparse trajectory data can be leveraged to identify key flow quantities including the velocity gradient, Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), and Lagrangian-Averaged Vorticity Deviation (LAVD), which are often used to identify LCS.

Research Abstracts from Brunton Lab,SINDy-RL: Interpretable and Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning,"SINDy-RL: Interpretable and Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning by Nicholas Zolman, Urban Fasel, J. Nathan Kutz, Steven L. Brunton  arxiv paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09110 github code: https://github.com/nzolman/sindy-rl  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown significant promise for uncovering sophisticated control policies that interact in environments with complicated dynamics, such as stabilizing the magnetohydrodynamics of a tokamak fusion reactor or minimizing the drag force exerted on an object in a fluid flow. However, these algorithms require an abundance of training examples and may become prohibitively expensive for many applications. In addition, the reliance on deep neural networks often results in an uninterpretable, black-box policy that may be too computationally expensive to use with certain embedded systems. Recent advances in sparse dictionary learning, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), have shown promise for creating efficient and interpretable data-driven models in the low-data regime. In this work we introduce SINDy-RL, a unifying framework for combining SINDy and DRL to create efficient, interpretable, and trustworthy representations of the dynamics model, reward function, and control policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on benchmark control environments and challenging fluids problems. SINDy-RL achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL algorithms using significantly fewer interactions in the environment and results in an interpretable control policy orders of magnitude smaller than a deep neural network policy.   %%% CHAPTERS %%% 00:00 Intro 01:25 What is Reinforcement Learning? 03:12 Reinforcement Learning Drawbacks 05:20 Dictionary Learning and SINDy 06:55 SINDy-RL: Environment 11:42 SINDy-RL: Reward 23:25 SINDy-RL: Agent 14:48 SINDy-RL: Uncertainty Quantification 20:07 Recap and Outro",00:21:28

Finite-time Lyapunov exponents,Stirring Faces: Mixing in a Quiescent Fluid,"This video illustrates mixing that occurs as a two-dimensional flat plate plunges sinusoidally in a quiescent fluid. Finite-time Lyapunov exponents reveal sets that are attracting or repelling. As the flow field develops, strange faces emerge.
